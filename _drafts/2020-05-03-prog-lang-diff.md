 Now, this is a trade off between compiled code and interpreted code. The first level is trade off. One big difference you can see is, its compiled code is generally faster to execute, that's because you don't have to do the translation every time you run the code, so it is going to be faster. Now, there are people who would argue the opposite, but generally compiled code is a lot faster. Now, on the other hand though, interpreters make coding easier. So, the thing about interpreters is that, the interpreter itself, that program that is doing the translation of your code, it can help you, it can handle things that you, as a programmer, don't want to handle.
